# TriageForce

Automated resource allocation for disaster relief using Agentic AI.

## Overview

TriageForce is an AI-powered disaster relief platform built with Salesforce Agentforce that automates resource matching and logistics for AidBridge Connect. Our solution reduces supply waste from 70% to near-zero and cuts response time from 5 days to real-time automated processing.

## The Problem

AidBridge Connect's 25-person team was overwhelmed managing:
- 5,000+ unique product types from 300+ corporate partners annually
- Manual matching process taking 3-5 days per large donation
- 70% of disaster supplies lost to waste and misallocation
- 30% of 10,000+ annual shipments facing delays or misrouting
- Zero transparency in tracking millions of individual items

## Our Solution
